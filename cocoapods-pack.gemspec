  A CocoaPods plugin that converts a given podspec into its binary version.
  For a given podspec, a zip file will be produced containing the binary representation of the original podspec sources.
  Each platform is packed as an `xcframework` within the zip file.
  Other attributes such as `resource_bundles` specified in the source podspec will also be packed.
  A binary podspec is also generated that can be published to a CocoaPods specs repo.
